       This was the original Rubik's Cube and it is one of the best cubes I have ever had. Just joking, it is the very worst cube. First of all it is over priced costing Â£10, you could by a good speed cube for that price. Also it is a pain to turn which makes finger tricks impossible and in addition to that it can't corner cut.
        <br> <br>
        Taking all of this into account you should never buy this cube. An alternative that is 10x better and cheaper is the Yuxin Little Magic.
