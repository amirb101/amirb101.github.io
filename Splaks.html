            <br><br> This cube is 2x2 and is a stickerless cube. However, they add carbon fibre stickers to make the puzzle look better. I think this is a good addition for most people but for some people this can get in the way and make look ahead slower. This cube turns really smoothly as it is lubed well and may need some tension loosening. The cube is like a Gans as it turns rather smoothly however unless tensions were very lose corner cutting wasn't the best. I think if the cube was worn in though it would corner cut better.

            In my opionion based on the paragraph above I think this cube is more appealing to beginners as it is cool looking and it helps beginners focus more on look ahead than tps which is very helpful for fast times. So far I havn't seen a better cube on the market that is this budget and it could do a good job in "splark"ing a love for 2x2.
