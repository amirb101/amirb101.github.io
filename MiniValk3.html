            The cube I will be reveiwing is the Mini Valk 3 made in honour of Matt Valk who broke the 3x3 world record and got 4.74 seconds. This cube is a tiny version of the Valk 3 and turns very well. However as it is a mini cube it has a lockup problem, this is worse in other mini puzzles and you wont notice it unless you are turning 10+ tps (turns per second). Also the Mini Valk has done a good job of keeping the hollow feel of the Valk 3 and is an excelent one handed chioice. The cube can turn very quickly and corner cutting is superb. <br><br> If your are looking to get a Valk cube I would suggest digging up a little bit more money and buy a Valk 3 Power which came out early December and has been marked highly by fans of the Valk 3. Furthermore because of the lockup problem I would suggest a Mini Weilong if you are looking for a mini cube or a Valk 3 Power if you want a Valk.
