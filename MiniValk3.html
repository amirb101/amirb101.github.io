            The Mini Valk 3 was made in honour of Matt Valk who broke the 3x3 single world record with a completion time of 4.74 seconds. This was the first sub 5 time ever. This cube is a tiny version of the Valk 3 and turns very well. However as it is a mini cube it has a lockup problem which is worse in other mini puzzles and you wont notice it unless you are turning 10+ tps (turns per second). The Mini Valk also succeeded in keeping the hollow feel of the Valk 3 and is an excellent one handed choice. The cube can turn very quickly and corner cutting is superb. <br><br> If your are looking to get a Valk cube I would suggest digging up a little bit more money and buy a Valk 3 Power which came out early December and has been marked highly by fans of the Valk 3. Furthermore because of the lockup problem I would suggest a Mini Weilong if you are looking for a mini cube for 1 hand or a Valk 3 Power if you want a Valk.
