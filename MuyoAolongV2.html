        This is a very good 3x3 if you are first getting into cubing as it is capable of getting sub 10 times and has a rather smooth feeling to it as opposed to a Valk 3 which is nice for beginners. The corner cutting is superb once the tensions are loosened and turning is very fast. This cube was an upgrade from the Muyo Aolong which is famous for Felix Zemdegs DNF. The Muyo Aolong V2 has fixed the main corner twisting issue in the Muyo Aolong.

        I would recomomened this cube for all levels of cube solvers because it is capable of getting very fast times and it doesn't corner twist much. The pricing is also in the mid-range which makes it affordable to most people.
